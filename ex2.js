/*
 There is value for infinity which is the name itself 
 -> if a = 5/0  mean the a value store the infiniity

 -> if a = 0/0  mean we cant even caluculate this so its NOT A NUMBER 
 then a store NaN

 -> let b;  This b is undefined if we print the value b mean it show uf

 -> In js threr is automatic type conversion which is if the value 
 string and we try to calculate the string with int means the string
 automatically calculated as int
 eg : '5'  - 1 -> 4

 -> type of keyword --> type of '5'-> String
*/

/* 
Comparision operator > < >= <=  == != === !==
== this operator wont considered the type '5' == 5 -> True
=== this do considered the type '5' == 5 -> False
